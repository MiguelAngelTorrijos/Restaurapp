# Restaurapp

The restaurant application project is a fullstack project containing backend and frontend.
This project has a complete CRUD of restaurants, also has a user with token validations and protected routes.
We can create, edit and delete restaurants, as well as add or delete your favorite restaurants.
It is a responsive project, with a logo created for the occasion.

## Starting üöÄ

Download the project, before initializing it you must install the dependencies.
To do this, navigate from the terminal to the project folder.

Here is an example:

```bash
npm install
```

## User data üôç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

```bash
user: admin
password: 123456
```

## Caution üëÅÔ∏è

Restaurant and user data are persisted in the backend itself in the mocks folder.
Note, that if you delete all the restaurants you will not be able to recover them.
I leave an example of a restaurant for hard code.

comments: "Mission Chinese Food has grown up from its scrappy Orchard Street days into a big, two story restaurant equipped with a pizza oven, a prime rib cart, and a much broader menu. Yes, it still has all the hits ‚Äî the kung pao pastrami, the thrice cooked bacon ‚Äîbut chef/proprietor Danny Bowien and executive chef Angela Dimayuga have also added a raw bar, two generous family-style set menus, and showstoppers like duck baked in clay. And you can still get a lot of food without breaking the bank."

comments: "This place is a blast. Must orders: GREEN TEA NOODS, sounds gross (to me at least) but these were incredible!, Kung pao pastrami (but you already knew that), beef tartare was a fun appetizer that we decided to try, the spicy ma po tofu SUPER spicy but delicous, egg rolls and scallion pancake i could have passed on... I wish we would have gone with a larger group, so much more I would have liked to try!"

comments: "I was VERY excited to come here after seeing and hearing so many good things about this place. Having read much, I knew going into it that it was not going to be authentic Chinese. The place was edgy, had a punk rock throwback attitude, and generally delivered the desired atmosphere. Things went downhill from there though. The food was okay at best and the best qualities were easily overshadowed by what I believe to be poor decisions by the kitchen staff."
